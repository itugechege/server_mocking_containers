# FTP Server with Redundancy and Backup

Welcome to the `ftp-server` project! This repository contains a Docker Compose setup for a large-scale, redundant FTP server with built-in backups and load balancing.

## Overview

The `ftp-server` project provides a scalable and highly available FTP solution using Docker. The setup includes:

- **Multiple FTP Server Instances**: For redundancy and load balancing.
- **Load Balancer**: Using Nginx to distribute incoming FTP requests across multiple servers.
- **Backup Service**: Regular backups of FTP data to ensure data integrity and recovery.

## Features

- **High Availability**: Redundant FTP servers to ensure service continuity.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming connections across multiple FTP servers.
- **Data Backup**: Regular backups to ensure data integrity.
- **Scalability**: Easy to scale by adding more FTP server instances.

## Directory Structure

Ensure you have the following directory structure:

### /ftp-server 

    ├── /data           Directory to store FTP data
    ├── /backups     <!-- # Directory to store backup files -->
    ├── /logs         <!-- # Directory to store log files -->
    ├── docker-compose.yml
    ├── Dockerfile
    └── README.md

## Backup Configuration
* The backup service uses crond to perform regular backups of the data directory:

* `Backup Command:` tar -czvf /backups/backup_$(date +%F_%T).tar.gz /data
* `Backup Interval:` Set to every 6 hours by default.


## Deploy and Manage
### 1. Build and Start Containers:

***run command***
`docker-compose up -d`


### 2. Monitor Containers:

Use Docker commands to check the status of the containers:

`docker ps
docker logs ftp_server_1
docker logs ftp_server_2
docker logs ftp_load_balancer`


### 3. Access Services:

* __FTP Server :__ Access via the load balancer’s IP or domain (e.g., ftp.example.com).

* __Backups :__ Backups are stored in the ./backups directory.

## Considerations
* __High Availability :__ Use a DNS round-robin or a dedicated load balancer service for better distribution and failover.

* __Scalability :__ Adjust the number of replicas and port ranges based on your scaling needs.

* __Security :__ Secure your FTP servers and backup processes with proper authentication and encryption.

## Scaling and Redundancy

* __Scaling :__ To add more FTP server instances, update the docker-compose.yml file with additional FTP service definitions and ensure proper port allocation.

* __Redundancy :__ The setup includes multiple FTP server instances and a load balancer to handle failures and distribute load.
